This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To start

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Tech used

#### [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
  For the user interface.

#### [Rx.js](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs)
  For streaming data and the pull based architecture it provides in React components.

#### [Akita](https://github.com/datorama/akita)
  For state management and reactive updates to the entire application.

### [Office UI Fabric for React](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react)
  For that good looking UI interface.

IMPORTANT: 
1. Use a CORS enable everywhere extension in the browser you are using.
2. Add the Colabel API Authentication token into [this](https://github.com/mlnj/classify-helper/blob/master/src/common.ts) replacing  `<<TOKEN TOKEN TOKEN>>`.
